# Loading from OASIS
The connect client is also installed and available through the OASIS Distributed Environment Modules system. This allows users that have OASIS installed to use the connect client.  In order to use the connect client, you'll need to load the modules system from OASIS if it's not installed yet.  In order to do this run:

	       source /cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/osg/modules/lmod/current/init/bash
   
After this, you should be able to load the connect client by running:

	       module load connect-client
  
Once the connect client is loaded, you can use the connect client as outlined in the other documents in this section.

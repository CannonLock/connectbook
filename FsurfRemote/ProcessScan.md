[title]: - "An example of processing a scan"
[TOC]


## Overview

In this section, we will demonstrate how to use the `fsurf` utility by analyzing
a brain scan. 

**Important note on data privacy**:  In order to protect the privacy of your
participantsâ€™ scans, we request that you submit only defaced and fully
deidentified scans for processing by fsurf.  Images can be anonymized and
deidentified before they are uploaded to OSG servers as described in [the
article on anonymizing images](https://support.opensciencegrid.org/support/solutions/articles/12000008493-anonymizing-images).

## Get a Sample MRI file

Type the following to get a sample MRI file, 

     $ curl -L -o MRN_3_defaced.mgz 'http://stash.osgconnect.net/+fsurf/MRN_3_defaced.mgz'

`MRN_3_defaced.mgz` is an MRI file that has already been defaced and anonymized. 

## Performing a Standard Image Reconstruction

A typical image reconstruction with FreeSurfer requires the execution of
autorecon1, autorecon2, and autorecon3 on MRI data.  All three steps are handled
by `fsurf`. 

Now we will create a workflow to process `MRN_3_defaced.mgz` using `fsurf`. In the
file `MRN_3_defaced.mgz`, the prefix `MRN_3` is the name of the subject. 


     $ ./fsurf submit --subject MRN_3 --input-file MRN_3_defaced.mgz

`MRN_3_defaced.mgz` image is already deidentified and defaced, so say `y` to the
following questions. 

     Has the MRI data been deidentified (This is required) [y/n]? y 
     Has the MRI data been defaced (This is recommended) [y/n]? y

After typing `y` to the above two questions, `fsurf` creates and submits the
workflow

     Creating and submitting workflow
     Workflow 97 created
     Uploading input files
     Uploading MRN_3_defaced.mgz (file 1/1)
     Uploaded MRN_3_defaced.mgz successfully


The ID of your workflow is `97`. The ID is needed to check the status, remove
and get the output of the workflow. 


## Reconstructing an Image With Multiple Inputs

In addition to the standard image reconstruction, FreeSurfer can also run the autorecon1, 
autorecon2, and autorecon3 steps with MGZ files from the same subject.  This allows FreeSurfer
to combine the scans to give a higher quality result.  This section shows how to run this workflow.

Now we will create a workflow to process `MRN_3` subject using `fsurf` and multiple input files. We'll
assume that the input files for `MRN_3` are called `MRN_3_defaced1.mgz`, and `MRN_3_defaced2.mgz`.

     $ ./fsurf submit --subject MRN_3 --input-file MRN_3_defaced1.mgz --input-file MRN_3_defaced2.mgz

The images should already be deidentified and defaced, so say `y` to the
following questions. 

     Has the MRI data been deidentified (This is required) [y/n]? y 
     Has the MRI data been defaced (This is recommended) [y/n]? y

After typing `y` to the above two questions, `fsurf` creates and submits the
workflow 

     Creating and submitting workflow
     Workflow 98 created
     Uploading input files
     Uploading MRN_3_defaced1.mgz (file 1/2)
     Uploaded MRN_3_defaced1.mgz successfully
     Uploading MRN_3_defaced2.mgz (file 2/2)
     Uploaded MRN_3_defaced2.mgz successfully

The ID of your workflow is `98`. The ID is needed to check the status, remove
and get the output of the workflow. 

## Running recon-all With Custom Options

FSurf also allows users to run recon-all with a set of custom options. Users can use this
workflow to run unique FreeSurfer workflows.

Type the following to get a sample MRI file,

     $ curl -L -o MRN_3_subject.zip 'http://stash.osgconnect.net/+fsurf/MRN_3_subject.zip'

`MRN_3_subject.zip` is an MRI file that has already been defaced and anonymized.

Now we will create a workflow that will run just the motion correction for the `MRN_3` 
subject using `fsurf`. Unlike the previous workflows, this workflow uses a zip file with the 
contents of a subject dir instead of a mgz file. To create this workflow, you'll need to run:

     $ ./fsurf submit --subject MRN_3 --subject-dir  MRN_3_subject.zip --options='-motioncor'

Note, that the options for FreeSurfer are surrounded by quotes and are given using the 
equal sign.  You need to do this so that the Fsurf script does not interpret them as options
for the script.

The images should already be deidentified and defaced, so say `y` to the
following questions. 

     Has the MRI data been deidentified (This is required) [y/n]? y 
     Has the MRI data been defaced (This is recommended) [y/n]? y

After typing `y` to the above two questions, `fsurf` creates and submits the
workflow 

     Creating and submitting workflow
     Workflow 99 created
     Uploading input files
     Uploading MRN_3_subject.zip (file 1/2)
     Uploaded MRN_3_subject.zip successfully

The ID of your workflow is `99`. The ID is needed to check the status, remove
and get the output of the workflow. 

### Generating Subject Directory Files

The subject directory file used by Fsurf when running a custom workflow can be
generated in several ways:

If you are starting with a MRI scan in mgz format,
you can run `recon-all -s SUBJECT -i SUBJECT_FILE` where `SUBJECT` is
the subject name (e.g. `MRN_3`) and `SUBJECT_FILE` is the name of the scan file
(e.g. `MRN_3_defaced.mgz`).  Once recon-all has completed, do the following:

     $ cd SUBJECTS_DIR
     $ zip -r SUBJECT_FILE.zip SUBJECT_NAME

Here `SUBJECTS_DIR` should be the location of the FreeSurfer subjects directory,
`SUBJECT_FILE` is the name that you'd like to use for the input file, and
`SUBJECT_NAME` is the subject name.


If you have already done some processing of the subject's data in FreeSurfer,
then you can just do the following:

     $ cd SUBJECTS_DIR
     $ zip -r SUBJECT_FILE.zip SUBJECT_NAME

Here `SUBJECTS_DIR` should be the location of the FreeSurfer subjects directory,
`SUBJECT_FILE` is the name that you'd like to use for the input file, and
`SUBJECT_NAME` is the subject name.
 

##  Listing Workflows

To get the status of this workflow, run the following command:

     $ ./fsurf list 
     Current workflows
     Subject    Workflow   Submit time (Central Time)  Cores      Status     Tasks completed
     MRN_3      97         Fri Sep 30 15:53:51 2016    8          COMPLETED  4/4

The screen output shows that there is just one workflow in the list with the
subject name `MRN_3`. The status of the workflow is `RUNNING`. Two cores are 
being used for this workflow. The ID of the workflow is `97`. 

A unique ID is assigned to each submitted workflow. The ID is useful to get the
output or remove the workflow from the list. 

A workflow can have the following status:

* QUEUED - workflow has been created
* RUNNING - workflow is being run
* FAILED - an error occurred while the workflow was running
* COMPLETED  - workflow has successfully completed
* DELETE PENDING  - workflow will be deleted soon
* DELETED - workflow has been removed
* ERROR - an error occurred with the workflow

##  Getting Outputs

Depending on the computer resources available, a workflow will typically
requires 6-12 hours to complete.  Once a workflow has completed successfully,
the status of the workflow should be `COMPLETED` as below

     $ ./fsurf list
     Current workflows
     Subject    Workflow   Submit time (Central Time)  Cores      Status     Tasks completed
     MRN_3      97         Fri Sep 30 15:53:51 2016    8          COMPLETED  4/4

Run the command below to get the output of the completed workflow by using its ID:

     $ ./fsurf output --id 97

The output files are compressed as a single file `MRN_3_output.tar.bz2` in the current work
directory. You can extract all the files in the archive using:

    $ tar -jxvf MRN_3_output.tar.bz2

 Similarly, you get the FreeSurfer logs of any completed  workflow with ID `WorkflowID`

     $ ./fsurf output --id WorkflowID  --log-only


##  Removing Workflows

Make sure you have downloaded the output of a workflow before you remove it.
Run the following command to remove an existing workflow:

    $ ./fsurf remove --id WorkflowID

For example, to remove a running worflow with an ID `97`, type

    $ ./fsurf remove --id 97
    Workflow removed

This will not affect the files you have downloaded already. Please note that
the results of a workflow will be removed after a certain period of time. However
you will be emailed a warning a few days before results are removed.

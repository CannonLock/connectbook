[title]: - "Analyzing a Brain MRI Scan"
[TOC]


## Overview

In this section, we will demonstrate how to use the `fsurf` utility by analyzing
a brain scan. 

**Important note on data privacy**:  In order to protect the privacy of your
participantsâ€™ scans, we request that you submit only defaced and fully
deidentified scans for processing by fsurf.  Images can be anonymized and
deidentified before they are uploaded to OSG servers as described in [the
article on anonymizing images](https://support.opensciencegrid.org/support/solutions/articles/12000008493-anonymizing-images).

## Get a Sample MRI file

Type the following to get a sample MRI file, 

     curl -L -o MRN_3_defaced.mgz 'http://stash.osgconnect.net/+fsurf/MRN_3_defaced.mgz'

`MRN_3_defaced.mgz` is an MRI file that has already been defaced and anonymized. 


## Performing an Image Reconstruction 

A typical image reconstruction with FreeSurfer requires the execution of
autorecon1, autorecon2, and autorecon3 on MRI data.  All three steps are handled
by `fsurf`. 

Now we will create a workflow to process `MRN_3_defaced.mgz` using `fsurf`. In the
file `MRN_3_defaced.mgz`, the prefix `MRN_3` is the name of the subject. Note,
that `fsurf` expects the input file to be named `subject_defaced.mgz` where
`subject` is the name of the subject given by the `--subject` option. 

     $ ./fsurf submit --subject MRN_3 

`MRN_3_defaced.mgz` image is already deidentified and defaced, so say `y` to the
following questions. 

     Has the MRI data been deidentified (This is required) [y/n]? y 
     Has the MRI data been defaced (This is recommended) [y/n]? y

After typing `y` to the above two questions, `fsurf` creates and submits the
workflow 

     Creating and submitting workflow 
     Workflow 97 submitted for processing

The ID of your workflow is `97`. The ID is needed to check the status, remove
and get the output of the workflow. 

##  Listing Workflows

To get the status of this workflow, run the following command:

     $ ./fsurf list 
     Current workflows
     Subject    Workflow             Submit time          Cores          Status
     MRN_3       97                  01-19-2016 10:00      2             PROCESSING

The screen output shows that there is just one workflow in the list with the
subject name `MRN_3`. The status of the workflow is `PROCESSING` (same as
running). Two cores are being used for this workflow. The ID of the workflow is
`97`. 

A unique ID is assigned to each submitted workflow. The ID is useful to get the
output or remove the workflow from the list. 

A workflow can have the following status:

* UPLOADED - workflow has been created
* PROCESSING - workflow is being run 
* FAILED - an error occurred while the workflow was running
* COMPLETED  - workflow has successfully completed
* DELETE PENDING  - workflow will be deleted soon
* DELETED - workflow has been removed
* ERROR - an error occurred with the workflow

##  Getting Outputs

Depending on the computer resources available, a workflow will typically
requires 6-12 hours to complete.  Once a workflow has completed successfully,
the status of the workflow should be `COMPLETED` as below

     $ ./fsurf list
     Current workflows
     Subject    Workflow             Submit time          Cores           Status
     MRN_3       97                  01-19-2016 18.20      2               COMPLETED

Run the command below to get the output of the completed workflow by using its ID:

     $ ./fsurf output --id 97

The output files are compressed as a single file `MRN_3_output.tar.bz2` in the current work
directory. You can extract all the files in the archive using:

    $ tar -jxvf MRN_3_output.tar.bz2

 Similarly, you get the FreeSurfer logs of any completed  workflow with ID `WorkflowID`

     $ ./fsurf output --id WorkflowID  --log-only


##  Removing Workflows

Make sure you have downloaded the output of a workflow before you remove it.
Run the following command to remove an existing workflow:

    $ ./fsurf remove --id WorkflowID

For example, to remove a running worflow with an ID `56`, type

    $ ./fsurf remove --id 56
    Workflow removed

This will not affect the files you have downloaded already. Please note that
the results of a workflow will be removed after a certain period of time. However
you will be emailed a warning a few days before results are removed.

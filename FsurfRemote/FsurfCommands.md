## Submit Options

**Important note on data privacy**:  In order to protect the privacy of your
participantsâ€™ scans, we request that you submit only defaced and fully
deidentified scans for processing by `fsurf`.  Images can be anonymized and
deidentified before they are uploaded to OSG servers as described in [the
article on anonymizing
images](https://support.opensciencegrid.org/support/solutions/articles/12000008493-anonymizing-images).

The submit command accepts the following options:

| ------ | ----------- |
| --user | Username to use when logging into the FSurf service |
| --help | Display help for command |
| --subject | Name of subject to process.  | 
| --dir | Directory containing MRI scans for subject.  `fsurf` expects the input file to be named `subject_defaced.mgz` where `subject` is the subject name given by the `--subject` option. |
| --dualcore | Use 2 cores rather than 8 for per hemisphere processing.  This allow the processing to complete when 8 core systems are not available |

[title]: - "Set up Fsurf on Your Laptop"

Set up Fsurf on your laptop (linux/unix/MacOS X OS system) by downloading the script using the `curl` command. You need to install python.2.7 on your laptop (or desktop) to run fsurf. Open a terminal window and then run:

      curl -L -o fsurf 'http://stash.osgconnect.net/+fsurf/fsurf'
      chmod +x fsurf 

If you don't have a Fsurf password, open a ticket requesting an account [here](https://support.opensciencegrid.org/support/tickets/new). 

## What next? 

See how to submit an example FreeSurfer workflow  from your laptop with Fsurf.

[title]: - "Setting up Fsurf on Your Computer"

Set up Fsurf on your computer (linux/unix/MacOS X OS system) by downloading the script using the `curl` command. Open a terminal window and then run:

      curl -L -o fsurf 'http://stash.osgconnect.net/+fsurf/fsurf'
      chmod +x fsurf 

If you don't have an Fsurf account, open a ticket requesting one [here](https://support.opensciencegrid.org/support/tickets/new).

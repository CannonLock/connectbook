[title]: - "Introduction to Fsurf and FreeSurfer"



## Overview

[FreeSurfer](http://freesurfer.net/) is a software package to analyze MRI scans
of human brains. The Open Science Grid (OSG) has developed a command line
utility, Fsurf, that simplifies running a FreeSurfer 5.3 workflow on the OSG.  

## Prerequisites
To install and use Fsurf utility, you'll need a few things:

* A computer with FreeSurfer installed (for anonymizing scans)
* A computer with Python 2.6+ (this can be the same as the computer above) - Most linux/unix systems released in the last several years already support this and Mac OS X versions released after 2012 also provide this
* A ethernet or fast wireless connection if you are processing multiple scans at once

## Privacy and confidentiality
In order to protect the privacy of your participantsâ€™ scans, we request that you
submit only defaced and fully deidentified scans for processing by Fsurf. Images
can be anonymized and deidentified before they are uploaded to OSG servers as
described in the article on [anonymizing images](https://support.opensciencegrid.org/solution/articles/12000008493-anonymizing-images).

## Introduction to Fsurf

Fsurf is designed to be easily used from any computer running macOS, OS X, or Linux/Unix.  The Fsurf script just requires Python and a network connection in order to run and process MRI scans.  When run, the script will upload your scan to the Fsurf server.  The Fsurf server then uses compute nodes available through OSG in order to process scans using FreeSurfer and stores the resulting output.  When you are notified that a scan has completed, you can use the Fsurf script to download the output to your computer.

[title]: - "Introduction to Fsurf and FreeSurfer"
 
## Overview

[FreeSurfer](http://freesurfer.net/) is a software package to analyze MRI images of human brain subjects. The OSG has developed a command line utility, `fsurf`, that simplifies `FreeSurfer` computation on the Open 
Science Grid (OSG).  To use Fsurf, first you need to get an account. Follow the instructions outlined in the section on Get an account (LINK).  

In the following sections, we describe 

* the proceedure to get an account, 
* initial set up of `Fsurf` on your laptop (or desktop)
* run image analysis from your laptop 
* get the output back to your laptop

Fsurf is easy to install and use from a laptop, desktop or a dedicated server. All it requires is a machine with a network connection and Python installed.  It takes only a few minutes to set up the tool and submit an image analysis job on the OSG.

**Important note on data privacy**: The `fsurf` tool is *not* HIPPA compliant. (HIPPA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, is a federal law written to protect personal medical information.) Therefore images must be anonymized and deidentified before they are uploaded to OSG servers as we discussed in the section ------

## What next?
If you don't have a Fsurf account, get an account. Otherwise, set up Fsurf.

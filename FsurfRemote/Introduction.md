[title]: - "Introduction to Fsurf and FreeSurfer"
 
## Overview

[FreeSurfer](http://freesurfer.net/) is a software package to analyze MRI images of human brain subjects. The OSG has developed a command line utility, `fsurf`, that simplifies `FreeSurfer` computation on the Open 
Science Grid (OSG).  

To use Fsurf, first you need to have a Fsurf account. Follow the instructions outlined [here to obtain an account.](https://support.opensciencegrid.org/support/solutions/articles/12000008487-request-a-fsurf-account-)

In the following sections, we describe 

* [the proceedure to get an account](https://support.opensciencegrid.org/support/solutions/articles/12000008487-request-a-fsurf-account-)
* [initial set up of Fsurf on your laptop (or desktop)](https://support.opensciencegrid.org/support/solutions/articles/12000008488-set-up-fsurf-on-your-laptop)
* [run image analysis from your laptop](https://support.opensciencegrid.org/support/solutions/articles/12000008490-anlysis-of-a-brain-mri-scan)
* [get the output back to your laptop](https://support.opensciencegrid.org/support/solutions/articles/12000008491-managing-your-output-files)


Fsurf is easy to install and use from a laptop, desktop or a dedicated server. All it requires is a machine with a network connection and Python installed.  It takes only a few minutes to set up the tool and submit an image analysis job on the OSG.

**Important note on data privacy**: The `fsurf` tool is *not* HIPPA compliant. (HIPPA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, is a federal law written to protect personal medical information.) Therefore images must be anonymized and deidentified before they are uploaded to OSG servers as we discussed in the section ------

## What next?
If you don't have a Fsurf account, get an account. Otherwise, set up Fsurf.

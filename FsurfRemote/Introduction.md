[title]: - "Introduction to Fsurf and FreeSurfer"



## Overview

[FreeSurfer](http://freesurfer.net/) is a software package to analyze MRI scans
of human brains. The Open Science Grid (OSG) has developed a command line
utility, Fsurf, that simplifies running a FreeSurfer 5.3 workflow on the OSG.  

## Prerequisites
To install and use Fsurf utility, you'll need a few things:

* A computer with FreeSurfer installed (for anonymizing scans)
* A computer with Python 2.6+ (this can be the same as the computer above) - Most linux/unix systems released in the last several years already support this and Mac OS X versions released after 2012 also provide this
* A ethernet or fast wireless connection if you are processing multiple scans at once

## Privacy and confidentiality
In order to protect the privacy of your participantsâ€™ scans, we request that you
submit only defaced and fully deidentified scans for processing by Fsurf. Images
can be anonymized and deidentified before they are uploaded to OSG servers as
described in the article on [anonymizing images](https://support.opensciencegrid.org/solution/articles/12000008493-anonymizing-images).

## Using Fsurf

You need an account to use Fsurf. Apply for the account  by 
following [the instructions outlined here](https://opensciencegrid.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/12000008487-requesting-an-fsurf-account).

Fsurf is easy to install and use from any computer. All it requires is a machine
with a network connection and Python installed.  It takes only a few minutes to
set up and run an image analysis job on the OSG.

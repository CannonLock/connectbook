[title]: - "Introduction to Fsurf and FreeSurfer"
 
## Overview

[FreeSurfer](http://freesurfer.net/) is a software package to analyze MRI scans of human brains. The Open Science Grid (OSG) has developed a command line utility, Fsurf, that simplifies running a FreeSurfer 5.3 workflow on the OSG.  

To use Fsurf, you need an account. Follow the instructions outlined [here to obtain an account](https://support.opensciencegrid.org/support/solutions/articles/12000008487-request-a-fsurf-account-).

**Important note on data privacy**:  In order to protect the privacy of your participantsâ€™ scans, we request that you submit only defaced and fully deidentified scans for processing by `fsurf`.  Images can be anonymized and deidentified before they are uploaded to OSG servers as described in [the article on Anonymizing Images](https://support.opensciencegrid.org/support/solutions/articles/12000008493-anonymizing-images).

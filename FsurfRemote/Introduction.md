[title]: - "Introduction to Fsurf and FreeSurfer"
 
## Overview

[FreeSurfer](http://freesurfer.net/) is a software package to analyze MRI images of human brain subjects. The OSG has developed a command line utility, Fsurf, that simplifies FreeSurfer computation on the Open Science Grid (OSG).  

To use Fsurf, you need an Fsurf account. Follow the instructions outlined [here to obtain an account.](https://support.opensciencegrid.org/support/solutions/articles/12000008487-request-a-fsurf-account-)

We describe the proceedure to:

* [Obtain an Fsurf account](https://support.opensciencegrid.org/support/solutions/articles/12000008487-request-a-fsurf-account-)
* [Set up Fsurf on your laptop](https://support.opensciencegrid.org/support/solutions/articles/12000008488-set-up-fsurf-on-your-laptop)
* [Run image analysis from your laptop](https://support.opensciencegrid.org/support/solutions/articles/12000008490-anlysis-of-a-brain-mri-scan)
* [Transfer output back to your laptop](https://support.opensciencegrid.org/support/solutions/articles/12000008491-managing-your-output-files)

Fsurf is easy to install and use from a laptop, desktop or a dedicated server. All it requires is a machine with a network connection and Python installed.  It takes only a few minutes to set up the tool and submit an image analysis job on the OSG.

**Important note on data privacy**: The `fsurf` tool is *not* HIPPA compliant. (HIPPA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, is a federal law written to protect personal medical information.) Therefore images must be anonymized and deidentified before they are uploaded to OSG servers as described in
[Anonymozing Images](https://support.opensciencegrid.org/support/solutions/articles/12000008493-anonymizing-images)

## What's next?
If you don't have a Fsurf account, get an account. Otherwise, set up Fsurf.

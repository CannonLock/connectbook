## On-Boarding Scenario: Username on application is not a GlobusID or Email is not a university/institutional email.

* Copy and paste the user's "Member Info" into a note in the account application ticket.
* Send the user an email informing them of the issue and asking them to re-apply.
    * ***Sample email (no GlobusID): "We got your application to join OSG Connect.  In the application, the username is XXXXXXX.  This username is based on an institute provided ID, but it needs to be a GlobusID.  On our system it is difficult to create and maintain a unix account with a username other than a globusID.  Could you please re-apply with a globusID as username as outlined here: https://osgconnect.net/signup.  I will remove your current pending application so that you will be able to re-apply. -Agent"***
    * ***Sample email (no institutional email): "We received your application to join OSG Connect.  The email you used for the account application is a XXXXX address.  Could you please re-apply and this time supply your XXXXX University email address so that we can verify your affiliation?  I will remove the current application so that you will be able to re-apply. -Agent"***
* Reject the application for both the "osg" and "connect" groups so that they will be able to re-apply.
* Change ticket status to "waiting on customer".
* If user re-applies, merge the two tickets.  If user does not re-apply, resolve the original ticket after waiting a week or so.

## On-Boarding Scenario: User has no apparent affiliation with a non-profit U.S. research institution or project.

* Copy and paste the user's "Member Info" into a note in the account application ticket.
* Send the user an email informing them of the issue and asking if they have a U.S. affiliation.
    * ***Sample email: "We received your application for an OSG Connect account. One of the requirements to have an account on OSG Connect is that the applicant needs to have an affiliation with  a US Institution.  Do you have an affiliation with a U.S. institution, organization, or project that was not listed on your application? -Agent"***
* Change ticket status to "waiting on customer".
* If user does not reply in a week or so, reject the application for both the "osg" and "connect" groups and resolve the ticket.  If user provides an appropriate affiliation, contine with on-boarding process outlined above (make sure to still require institutional email or some other verification of affiliation).

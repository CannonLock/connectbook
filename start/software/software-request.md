[title]: - "Request Help with Your Software"

A large number of software packages can be used by compiling a portable installation or using a container 
(many community sofwares are already available in authoritative containers).  If you believe none of
these options ([described here](5000634395)) are applicable for your software, you may request that software
be added to OSG's OASIS software library with a simple email to
[support@opensciencegrid.org][support], along the following lines:

[catalog]: 5000634397
[support]: mailto:support@opensciencegrid.org?subject=Please%20install%20_______%20in%20OASIS

	
	To: support@opensciencegrid.org
	Subject: Please install _______ in OASIS
	
	Hello OSG User Support -
	
	My name is _______ and I am using OSG resources to perform research
	in the field of _______. It would be helpful to me to have the
	_______ software (version _______) available on the grid.  Please
	find details on installing this software at the following web site:
	_________________.


As long as this code is:

1. available to the public in source form (e.g. open source)
2. licensed to all users, and does not require a license key
3. would not be better supported by another approach (which are usually preferable)

we should be able to install it in the OSG software respository which will make it available on most sites in the OSG. In any case, OSG staff will help you with the 'right' solution.

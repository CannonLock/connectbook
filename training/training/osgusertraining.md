[title]: - "Bi-Monthly OSG User Training (registration+materials)"

# Sign Up for Upcoming Trainings!

All User Training sessions are offered from 2:30-4pm ET (and usually on Tuesdays). New User Training is offered monthly, generally on the first Tuesday of the month, and training on various additional topics happens on the third Tuesday of the month. It's best to already have an active account on an OSG Connect login node (or other access point that submits to the Open Science Pool) to follow along with hands-on examples, but anyone can listen in by registering.

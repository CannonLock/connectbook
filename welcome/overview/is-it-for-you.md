[title]: - "Is the Open Science Grid for You?"


The [Open Science Grid][osg] is a national network that offers a strategic advantage 
for computing work that can be run as numerous short tasks. 


|   		| **Ideal jobs!**| **Still very advantageous** | **Less-so, but maybe** | 
|:----------|:--------------|:--------------|:--------------|
| CPU		|	1			|	<8			|	>8 (or MPI)	|
| Walltime	| 	<12 hrs		|	<24 hrs		|	>24 hrs		|
| RAM		| 	< few GB	|	<10s GB		|	>10s GB		|
| Input		| 	<500 MB		|	<10 GB		|	>10 GB		|
| Output	| 	< 1GB		|	<10 GB		|	>10 GB		|
| Software	| pre-compiled binaries, containers | Most other than -> | Licensed software, non-Linux |

For problems that can be run as many independent jobs, as in the first two columns 
of the table above, the OSG provides practically-unlimited resources, with the possibility 
of having hundreds or even thousands of computer cores in use at once. Access 
to this amount of computing capacity can transform the types of questions that researchers 
are able to tackle. 

Some examples of work that have been a good fit for the OSG and benefited from 
using its resources include: 

- MRI image analysis
- DNA read mapping
- parameter sweeps
- Monte Carlo methods

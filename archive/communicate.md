## Receive status updates

The OSG User Support Twitter account is
[@osgusers](http://twitter.com/osgusers).  We will report issues in
near real time using that feed so you have one place to look for late
breaking news or updates.

## Send a direct message

Additionally, you can report problems or questions directly
from your Twitter account by sending a direct message (DM) to
[@osgusers](http://twitter.com/osgusers).  If you link your Twitter
account with your OSG help desk account, we'll be able to track and
follow-up more efficiently.

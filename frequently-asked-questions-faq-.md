Please refer the section on "Best practices - Computation" for more details.

###Data Storage and Transfer
**What is the best way to process large volume of data?**

Use the "stash"  storage to  process large data. Please refer the section "Data Solutions" for more details. 
 
**How do I transfer data from stash to Midway and vice versa?**

You can transfer data using  - scp, rsync and globus. See the section on "Data Solutions" for more details.
Scientific Workflow Management (SWM)

**What is the use of scientific workflow management?**

Scientific workflow management systems help to deal with computations or data manipulations.

**What SWM systems are recommended on OSG?**

DAGMan, Pegasus and Swift.

###Workshops and Training
*Do you plan to offer training sessions and workshop?*

We plan to offer workshops for the researchers on multiple locations. Please check our events page for further information about the workshop dates and venue. 
 
**Who may attend the workshop?**

Student, post doc, staff and faculty.
 
**What are the topics covered in a typical workshops?**

We plan to cover  shell script, python (or R) programming, version control with git  and distributed hight throughout computing.  

**How to cite or acknowledge OSG?**

Whenever you make use of Open Science Grid resources, services or tools, we would be grateful to have you acknowledge OSG in your presentations and publications. 
 For example, you can add in your acknowledgement section:
This research was done using resources provided by the Open Science Grid.
